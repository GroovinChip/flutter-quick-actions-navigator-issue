# quick_actions_navigator_issue

This flutter application addresses issue #25348 at the flutter repository:
https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/25348

In this example, if the app is running in the background while the quick action is pressed, the
Navigator activates. However, if the app is not running in the background when the action is pressed,
nothing happens at all - the app doesn't even open.
